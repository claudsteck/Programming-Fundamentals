# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 5-loops.rb

# Infinite Tacos -> Finite Tacos
# loop do
#   puts "tacos!"
# end

# Loop through tacos
tacos = ["carnitas", "carne asada", "pollo", "pescado", "veggie"]
for taco in tacos
    puts "Eat #{taco} tacos!"
    end

# below is an alternative to the above live code, the above is doing all of the same as below:
#set an index variable
# index = 0

# #start loop
# loop do
# #break the loop if the # of elements is the same as the index
# if tacos.length == index
#     break
# end 
# # assign a variable to each taco
# taco = tacos [index]

# # print the output
# puts "Eat #{tacos[index]} tacos!"

# #increment the index
# index = index + 1 

# end
